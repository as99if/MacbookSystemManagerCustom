### Database Structure

All monitoring data is stored in SQLite database `/var/log/AudioVideoMonitor.db`:

```sql
-- Process execution and lifecycle events
process_events (timestamp, pid, ppid, executable_path, command_line, 
                bundle_id, uid, gid, event_type, cpu_time, memory_usage)

-- File system access events  
file_access (timestamp, pid, file_path, access_type, was_blocked, reason)

-- Network connection tracking
network_connections (timestamp, pid, protocol, local_address, local_port,
                    remote_address, remote_port, state)

-- System call monitoring
system_calls (timestamp, pid, syscall_name, arguments, return_value)

-- Memory region analysis
process_memory (timestamp, pid, memory_region, permissions, size, file_path)

-- Dynamic library tracking
loaded_libraries (timestamp, pid, library_path, load_address)

-- Environment variable capture
environment_vars (timestamp, pid, var_name, var_value)
```

### Main Application

```bash
# Using the main app directly
./AudioVideoMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioVideoMonitor install
./AudioVideoMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioVideoMonitor control disable-mic
./AudioVideoMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/AudioVideoMonitor status
```

### Forensic Analysis Examples

**Monitor all system activity**:
```bash
# Start comprehensive monitoring
sudo systemmonitor monitor

# Monitor specific process
systemmonitor analyze 1234

# Search for suspicious activity  
systemmonitor search "malware"
systemmonitor search "/tmp/"
systemmonitor search "curl"
```

**Memory and process analysis**:
```bash
# Dump process memory for analysis
systemmonitor dump 1234

# Analyze process behavior
systemmonitor processes | grep chrome
systemmonitor files | grep "/etc/passwd"
systemmonitor network | grep ":443"
```

**Data export for analysis**:
```bash
# Export all data to CSV
systemmonitor export

# Query database directly
sqlite3 /var/log/AudioVideoMonitor.db "SELECT * FROM process_events WHERE pid = 1234"
```

### System Cleanup and Optimization Examples

**System performance analysis**:
```bash
# Comprehensive system analysis
systemcleanup analyze

# Check current system status
systemcleanup status

# Generate cleanup recommendations
AudioVideoMonitor cleanup analyze
```

**Memory and performance optimization**:
```bash
# Free up system memory
systemcleanup memory

# Clean all system caches
systemcleanup cache

# Complete system optimization
systemcleanup full

# Preview cleanup without execution
systemcleanup full --dry-run
```

**Background process management**:
```bash
# Clean unnecessary background services
systemcleanup services

# Preview service cleanup
systemcleanup services --dry-run

# Conservative cleanup only
systemcleanup safe-mode

# Restore to fresh boot state
systemcleanup restore
```

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Maximum Access Permissions

The system extension now operates with maximum privileges:

- **Full File System Access**: Unrestricted access to all files and directories
- **Process Debugging**: Ability to attach to and analyze any process
- **Memory Access**: Read and dump memory from any process
- **Network Monitoring**: Complete network traffic analysis
- **System Call Interception**: Monitor all system interactions
- **Hardware Access**: Direct access to audio, video, and USB devices
- **Kernel Communication**: Direct communication with kernel services

### Comprehensive Event Monitoring

The extension monitors these event types:
- Process lifecycle (exec, exit, fork, signal)
- File operations (open, close, read, write, delete, rename)
- Memory operations (mmap, munmap, mprotect)
- Network operations (connect, bind, listen, accept)
- System calls and kernel interactions
- Hardware device access attempts
- Authentication and privilege escalation events

### Privacy Considerations

- **Minimal data collection**: Only monitors device access attempts
- **User space execution**: No kernel-level access
- **Apple oversight**: Extension requires Apple entitlements
- **Transparent logging**: All actions logged to system console

### Code Signing

All components are code signed with Developer ID:

```bash
# Check signatures
codesign -vv AudioVideoMonitor.app
codesign -vv /usr/local/bin/avcontrol
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not loading**:
```bash
# Check system extension status
systemextensionsctl list

# Check console for errors
log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.example.AudioVideoMonitor"' --last 1h
```

**Permission denied errors**:
```bash
# Verify entitlements
codesign -d --entitlements - AudioVideoMonitor.app

# Check TCC database
sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \
  "SELECT client,auth_value FROM access WHERE service='kTCCServiceMicrophone';"
```

**XPC communication failures**:
```bash
# Check XPC service status
launchctl list | grep com.example.AudioVideoMonitor

# Test direct communication
avcontrol status
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
# Set debug environment variable
export AVCONTROL_DEBUG=1
avcontrol status

# Check system logs
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.example.AudioVideoMonitor"'
```
